Install Java:
check into root
=> sudo su 
=> sudo su apt update
=> sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

To check installed version:
=> java --version 

Step: To add Jenkins repository

=> wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add –
( when the key is added, the system will return OK, next append the debian package repository address to the servers source lsit)

Step: To add Jenkins repo to the system

=> sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
(When both of these are in place, run UPDATE, so that apt will use the new repository)

Step: To install Jenkins

=> sudo apt update
(Finally install Jenkins and it's dependencies)

=> sudo apt install Jenkins
(Now that Jenkins and it's dependencies are in place)
     Let's start Jenkins server

Step: To verify installation

=> sudo systemctl start Jenkins
(Since systemctl command doesn't display output, you can use it's status command to verify that Jenkins started successfully)

=> sudo systemctl status Jenkins

Step: Opening the Firewall
By default, Jenkins runs on port 8080. So, let's open that port using ufw:

=> sudo ufw allow 8080
(check ufw's status to confirm the new rules)

=> sudo ufw status
( you will see that traffic is allowed to port 8080 from anywhere)

*If the Firewall is inactive, the following commands will allow openSSH and enable the Firewall:

=> sudo ufw allow openSSH
=> sudo ufw enable
(With Jenkins installed and our Firewall configured, we can complete the installation setup)

Step: To setting up Jenkins
* To set up your installation, visit Jenkins on it's default port, 8080.
using your server domain name or IP address ( http://<your-server-IP_ or domain:8080 )

-When open in new tab on browser
it displays the location of the initial password

*In the terminal window, use the 'cat' command to display the password
=> sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

( Copy that 32-character alphanumeric password from the terminal and paste it into the administration password field, then click CONTINUE)
*The command 'cat' is used to display anyfile data

-The next screen presents the option of installing SUGGESTED PLUGINS or SELECTING SPECIFIC PLUGINS:
(We will click the install suggested plugins option, which will immediately begin the installation process: 

-When the installation is complete, you will be prompted to setup the first administration user, it's possible setup to skip this step and
continue as ADMIN using the initial password we are used above, but we will take a moment to create the user.

=> Enter the name; password; Full name; Email address; --- SAVE & CONTINUE

you will see an instance configuration page that will ask you to confirm the preferred URL for your Jenkins instance.
confirm either the domain name for your server or your server IP address:   

-After confirming the appropriate information, click SAVE & FINISH, you will see a conformation page. 
                               Confirming that "Jenkins is Ready"

=> Click “Start using Jenkins” to visit the main Jenkins dashboard.
